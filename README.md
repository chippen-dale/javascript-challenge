# javascript-challenge
Consists of three files:
- index.html and two js files (app.js (with the code) and data.js with the data)

The app.js contains the logic that selects the data from the data.js file, finds the table body, builds the html structure and populates the data. 
In addition. the app.js file also captures the input field (datetime) that then filters the list, and rebuilds the html structure and data.
